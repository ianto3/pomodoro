# Pomodoro Timer

## Description

This App was used as practice to keep working on React. During the project i found out how setting a function relaying on setInterval can be complicated in React using hooks, needing to implement a custom hook (Dan Abramov has a [blog post](https://overreacted.io/making-setinterval-declarative-with-react-hooks/) to this specific problem) as a workaround.

I also got the chance to figure out ways to create animations for the timer and face certain difficulties that would arise.


## Technologies used

- React.js
- Autoprefixer
- gh-pages (for deployment on github)


## Usage

### Execution

You can run the application executing the following command:

```
npm start
```
